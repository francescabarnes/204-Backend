ðŸ‘‹ Hello Johnsons! Welcome to the MongoDB chapter of our course.

Over the next 8 days, we will cover a range of topics related to MongoDB, from installation and setup to advanced querying and data modeling. 

During the first three days, we will focus on getting you up to speed with the basics of MongoDB, including installation and setup, data modeling, and advanced querying and aggregation. These are all essential skills for anyone looking to work with MongoDB, and will serve as a strong foundation for the rest of the chapter.

Days 4 to 8 will be dedicated to building a football statistics app from scratch. This will give you a chance to put your newly acquired MongoDB skills into practice and create something that is both useful and fun. Along the way, you will learn how to create a web scraper, connect to MongoDB Atlas, create an API to serve player data, and use EJS and CSS to create a visually appealing frontend. 

ðŸ”Ž Skills you will practice during this chapter:
- Installing and setting up MongoDB on your local machine or cloud environment
- Creating and managing databases and collections in MongoDB
- Modeling data in MongoDB, including identifying entities and relationships and creating schemas
- Advanced querying and aggregation in MongoDB, including joins, sorting, filtering, and grouping
- Building a full-stack web application with MongoDB, Express, and Node.js
- Using EJS and CSS to create a visually appealing frontend
- Implementing a web scraper to extract data from a website

ðŸ’¡ General advice and tips:
- Take time to understand the fundamentals of MongoDB before diving into building the app. This will make the process much smoother and help you avoid common pitfalls.
- Use resources such as the MongoDB documentation, Stack Overflow, and online tutorials to help you along the way.
- Break the app-building process into smaller, more manageable steps, and focus on one step at a time.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help from your peers or instructor if you get stuck or need guidance.
- Have fun! Building a full-stack app can be challenging, but it's also an opportunity to be creative and build something you can be proud of.
